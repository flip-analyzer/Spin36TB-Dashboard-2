# 📄 START PAPER TRADING: Complete Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Run Your First Paper Trade
```bash
cd /Users/jonspinogatti/Desktop/spin36TB
python dual_strategy_portfolio.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Initialize both momentum + mean reversion systems
- ✅ Generate test market data  
- ✅ Make 65 trading decisions automatically
- ✅ Show complete performance results

### Step 2: Understand the Results
Look for these key metrics:
- **Portfolio Value**: Should be around $25,000 ± small changes
- **Strategy Correlation**: Should be negative (around -0.25 to -0.37)
- **Opposing Signals**: Should be 20-40% (perfect for diversification)
- **Win Rates**: Momentum ~50%, Mean Reversion ~80%

## 🎯 Manual Paper Trading (Recommended)

### Method 1: Use Existing Test System
```python
# Run this in Python terminal
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/jonspinogatti/Desktop/spin36TB')
from dual_strategy_portfolio import DualStrategyPortfolioManager

# Initialize with your capital
portfolio = DualStrategyPortfolioManager(starting_capital=25000)

# This automatically runs a complete test with ~60 decisions
# Just watch the results!
```

### Method 2: Step-by-Step Manual Control

1. **Generate Market Data**:
   ```python
   # The system automatically creates realistic EURUSD data
   # You'll see output like:
   # "Generated 2016 candles over 8 days"
   # "Price range: 1.0854 - 1.1140"
   ```

2. **Make Decisions**:
   ```python
   # The system will show decisions like:
   # "Decision 6: Strategies Active: 2, Signal Relationship: OPPOSING"
   # "MOMENTUM: UP (80.0% conf, HIGH_VOLATILITY)"  
   # "MEAN_REVERSION: DOWN (90.0% conf, Z=+2.50)"
   ```

3. **See Results**:
   ```python
   # Results show immediately:
   # "→ MOMENTUM: -9.9 pips (Stop Loss)"
   # "→ MEAN_REVERSION: +3.3 pips (Target Hit)"
   ```

## 📊 What You'll See

### Typical Decision Output:
```
Decision 10:
  Strategies Active: 2
  Signal Relationship: OPPOSING
     MOMENTUM: UP (80.0% conf, HIGH_VOLATILITY)
     MEAN_REVERSION: DOWN (90.0% conf, Z=+3.09)
  → MOMENTUM: +11.2 pips (Target Hit)
  → MEAN_REVERSION: +2.7 pips (Target Hit)
```
